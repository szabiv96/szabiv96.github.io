				My diploma project during the final year in the Hungarian University of Fine Arts, Painting Department is an FPS (First Person Shooter), a space-simulator computer game that is a crossover, multimedia artwork. <u>Gallery Destroyer 2020, is a virtual exhibition space as well, sort of a utopian, personal-memory-storage for the artworks; I‘ve made during college. </u> Artworks created during the five academic years are archived and installed here. This kind of summary was brought to life by the degree I arrived at. The virtual representation of my activity was formulated during the pandemic period. Every part of the game reflects my relationship and vision with visual art. <b>It could be considered as my statement about Art itself.</b> The most ideal work of art for me has got multiple layers of meaning, it’s got different interpretations as well, it’s an attempt to maintain attention for a long time, and it points out social problems with its symbolism. 
				</p>
				<p>
				With the FPS-game framework, we can interact destructively with artefacts. In real life and in real situations there is a physical distance between artefact and participant that does not let you touch the pieces of art. Any kind of physical interaction is prohibited, we are not even thinking about destroying them. The distance between the observer and the observed work of art is meant to be over bridged with this grotesque, provocative function. The distance I meant, is more of momentary bewilderment or confusion formed during the stereotypical thinking built around art, walls that hinder the development of a personal relationship with the observer.

					In order to enjoy the full gaming experience, you also <b>have to fight SARS-CoV</b>, or the coronavirus, in this virtual world, which has cornered us in our physical world for a while. The virus tries to stop the player at certain points in the game tries to overcome the player's life points. As a result of the damage system the player can lost at the very beginning of the level.
				</p>
				  
				<p>
					Two important rules of game development are the first to work in a team if you can, the second is to "don't reinvent the wheel". Which means that the completion and quality of the game does not require rethinking the basic functions. If you want to focus as much as possible on the development of visual elements, <u>add-ons should be used to create basic functions.</u> This means that everything that forms the basis of a computer game is available and can be purchased in an online store, in the same way that you can pick up all the parts of the shelfs while walking in Ikea, which can be immediately assembled at home.  
				</p>
				  
				<p>
					My first creative vision was a more ambitious one. I wanted to create a virtual nature world where you can find different buildings with different exhibitions of my works, but this idea was beyond my abilities during my last year in university. Then I realized I must focus on the essence of the game and leave unnecessary details for later upgrade.
